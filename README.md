### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year PhD student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://www.mrinmaya.io/). I work in the domain of understanding long texts ðŸ“š and explaining the decision made by the models.    
I am also a researcher at [NeuralSpace](https://neuralspace.ai/) where we try to bring NLP research to low resource languages.

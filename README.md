### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a third year PhD student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://www.mrinmaya.io/) in Switzerland, supervised by Prof. [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/) and [Nicholas Monath](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~nmonath/) from Google DeepMind. My PhD research investigate how generative LLMs reason, what factors affect their reasoning performance, and how to optimize their reasoning skills.
